  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>The Critspace framework defines the basic structure of a panel (a box with 
  certain visual properties and control areas) but doesn't say anything about 
  what type of content is displayed by the panel or how users can interact 
  with that content. This task is deferred to panel extensions. Here we'll take 
  a look at how to implement a panel extension. To do this, we'll walk through 
  the process of creating a simple panel extension, the ImagePanel, that will
  dispaly (you guessed it), an image.

  <h1>Setting Up</h1>
  
  <pre>
  (function() {  
      var PANEL_TYPE = "org.idch.example.ImagePanel";
      function ImagePanel(m_panel, cfg) {
          m_panel.configure(cfg);
          
          
      }
      
      IDCH.critspace.Workspace.register(PANEL_TYPE, ImagePanel);
  })();
  </pre>
